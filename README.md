# ExifMapOverlay <img align="right" width="40" height="40" src="https://github.com/sayofan/ExifMapOverlay/blob/main/src/exifMapOverlay/resources/logo_emo.ico?raw=true">
The purpose of this tool is to show a simple small map overlay when viewing photos.
Intended as a nice gimmick when reviewing vacation photos.
If a jpeg contains GeoLocation Data, fetch a map and place name from OpenStreetMap 
and display a small window always on top for a few seconds, then autoclose the map again.

I use IrfanView as image viewer, but I felt it misses this feature (in stock IrfanView, 
you need to press IðŸ¡’EðŸ¡’O (InfoðŸ¡’ExifðŸ¡’OpenStreetMap) to view a map in the browser), 
with this utility, you can just assign it as external editor in IrfanView and then 
press <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to open the map.

Here is what the overlay looks like:

## Installation
Dependencies for this project are [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/), 
[request](http://www.python-requests.org/) and 
[OSMPythonTools](https://github.com/mocnik-science/osm-python-tools). 
The latter has quite a few dependencies itself.

To install, you need python version 3.
Simplest way is then to use pip with
```bash
pip install exifMapOverlay
```
### Compiling to executable
You may want to package this into its own "standalone" executable. In that case, 
I recommend to first create a new virtual python environment and then use PyInstaller
with the `--onedir` argument.
The most straightforward way to get an executable is to create a new folder, 
open up a terminal inside that folder (under Windows use Powershell) and paste the following lines
```bash
python -m venv emoInstallEnv
./emoInstallEnv/Scripts/activate
pip install exifMapOverlay[installer]
python -m PyInstaller ./emoInstallEnv/Lib/site-packages/exifMapOverlay/__main__.py -n exifMapOverlay --onedir --hide-console hide-early --icon ./emoInstallEnv/Lib/site-packages/exifMapOverlay/resources/logo_emo.ico --distpath ./dist --exclude-module numpy
cp ./emoInstallEnv/Lib/site-packages/exifMapOverlay/resources/ ./dist/exifMapOverlay/_internal/exifMapOverlay/resources -r
rm exifMapOverlay.spec
rm -r ./build
rm -r ./emoInstallEnv
```
This should leave you with the folder structure 
```
.
â””â”€â”€ dist
    â””â”€â”€ exifMapOverlay
        â”œâ”€â”€ exifMapOverlay.exe
        â””â”€â”€ _internal
```
that contains the packaged program. If you want to move the program, just move the whole 
folder `exifMapOverlay`, i.e. the folder `_internal` must be kept next to the executable.
Once you have this executable, you can use it on another cmoputer with teh same operating
system even if python is not installed, since the needed python libraries are kept in the 
`_internal` folder.

In my expecrience, the folder _internal should end up taking about 50MB of disk space 
(which I know is a lot for a simple tool like this.) Due to the many dependencies of 
OSMPythonTools, there will be quite a few files in this folder that are not actually
needed, but I can't say which exactly. The exclusion of `numpy` is highly recommended
though, since on some distribtions, this may ship with MKL and be >500MB then.


## Usage
Call exifMapOverlay with the path to a jpeg file as single argument.
If you have installed it as a python module, use
```
python -m exifMapOverlay somePhoto.jpg
```
If you have packaged it with PyInstaller, use 
```
exifMapOverlay.exe somePhoto.jpg
```

### General usage
The map window can be dragged around with the mouse. The current position will be saved for the next program start.
You may want to set the Nominatim place names to a fixed language, to do so, edit the settings file. 
See [Settings](#settings) on how to find it. 

### Usage with IrfanView
If you are using IrfanView (such as myself), you can simply set up exifMapOerlay as an external editor, 
which will allow you to bring up the overlay from IrfanView by pressing e.g. <kbd>â‡§ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>. 
To do so navigate to OptionsðŸ¡’PropertiesðŸ¡’Miscellaneous and add the path to exifMapOverlay.exe 
(e.g. `C:\Users\sayofan\portableApps\exifMapOverlay\exifMapOverlay.exe`) as one of the external editors. 
There is no need to add any arguments, as IrfanView will automatically pass the current file name as first argument.


## Settings
There are a few simple settings like position of the window which are kept in a .json file. 
The file is stored under `{system temp folder}/ExifMapOverlay/emo_settings.json` and will be created upon the 
first execution of exifMapOerlay with default parameters.
For windows, the path might be e.g. `C:\Users\sayofan\AppData\Local\Temp\ExifMapOverlay\emo_settings.json`

The contents of the settings file are 
```jsonc
{
    "window_pos_x": 200,
    "window_pos_y": 100,
    "nominatim_language": null,  // null for native names; otherwise a http Accept-Language header (e.g. "de-DE")
    "tile_server_url_template": "https://tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",  // # OSM tile server. For a list, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Raster_tile_providers
    "tile_size_px": 256,  // the side length of the tiles. must be matched to the server. usually 256 or 512.
    "map_zoom_level": 6,  // tile zoom level, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels
    "map_pixel_size_x": 200,
    "map_pixel_size_y": 200,
    "place_text_font_size": 12,
    "approx_display_time_ms": 6000
}
```
To set e.g. english names, you can edit the fourth line of this file to 
```
"nominatim_language": "en",
```

## Remarks
This project uses [OSMPythonTools](https://github.com/mocnik-science/osm-python-tools) 
to access Nominatim and a slightly modified [Static Map](https://github.com/komoot/staticmap) 
(modified for caching) to access map tiles from OpenStreetMap.
Downloaded data is cached as required by OSM when using their APIs. I do not set an 
expiration date for the cache, it is simply stored in the system's tempfolder.

Please respect the usage policies of any tile server you use.
